# cpp-todolist
This is a C++ console application that implements a simple TODO list. It uses object-oriented programming principles to manage tasks of three types: normal tasks, tasks with deadlines, and tasks with priority levels. Users can add tasks, view all tasks, and mark tasks as completed. Ideal for learning C++ classes, inheritance, and basic management.
